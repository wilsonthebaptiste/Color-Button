About:

This is a personal project I am undertaking on a button clicker that will change background colors.

This will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The youtube video for the tutorial I used is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIjAGcMh3QA&list=PLtMugc7g4GaqAVDZwQ_t1H6500ZGJzOgW

Below I will place 'Eurekas' which are takeaways from the project.

Eurekas
1.JS files must be placed in the body of the HTML file
2.To add a function when you click a button, you must add 'onclick' to the button tag
3.Align-items in css will align the items of an object on the screen. However they are succeptible to the side of the container they are in.
