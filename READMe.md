About:

This is a personal project I am undertaking on a button clicker that will change background colors.

This will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The youtube video for the tutorial I used is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIjAGcMh3QA&list=PLtMugc7g4GaqAVDZwQ_t1H6500ZGJzOgW

Below I will place 'Eurekas' which are takeaways from the project.
